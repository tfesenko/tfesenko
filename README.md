I am a senior backend developer who helps companies modernize complex systems to innovate faster. 

With over fifteen years of building advanced systems globally, I now build Klaviyo's Customer Data Platform (CDP).

Before that, I was developing the seamles [data pipelines powering Crisp's mission](https://www.gocrisp.com/blog/spotlight-tanya-fesenko) to reduce food waste.
